    "In the previous sprint, we've covered some of the most basic summary statistics that are commonly used in data science to concisely describe how the values in a given sample behave.

In this print, we'll cover some of the more basic plotting types that we'll frequently encounter throughout the course.

Here we use a different way to see how the individual samples are distributed---a **rugplot**. These are very space efficient, while still containing a lot of the intuition of a density plot. Here we can see that most of the proportion datapoints fall within about $(0.25,0.34)$, but the samples are evenly distributed over time, which is nice.
