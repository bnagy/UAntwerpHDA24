Code and write down text answers in the designated blocks, as in the weekly assignments. **Don't forget to save your progress!** You have three hours to fill out the exam. You can earn a total of **17.5 points** (which will be combined with the permanent evaluation score): the distribution is indicated per exercise. When you have finished, save your notebook (include your name in the filename!) and **send it via email to mike.kestemont@uantwerpen.be and lisa.hilte@uantwerpen.be** \n",

    "- Some questions have been marked as hard: we advise you to only solve these after having solved the rest of the exam.\n",
    "- Provide an interpretion of your results whenever that is explicitly asked. Use full sentences and avoid telegram-style. Allow for nuance in your interpretation and make use of the relevant terminology.\n",
    "- Try to fill in at least something for every question: we cannot give any marks for an empty answer box. \n",
    "- Do not remove any outliers or rescale data, unless when you are explicitly asked to do so.\n",
    "- The required datasets are in the folder `datasets_exam`, which is saved in the same directory level (i.e. in the same folder) as this notebook.\n",
    "- You are allowed to use all course materials (slides, notebooks, handbook by Gries) and the internet (e.g. reading discussion fora). However, **communication with third parties (including fellow students) is strictly forbidden!**\n",

    "TIME Magazine is an influential periodical US publication that has covered America's domestic and global politics for many decades now. For a recent publication in the *Journal of Cultural Analytics*, [Jofre et al. (2020)](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/12266-what-s-in-a-face-gender-representation-of-faces-in-time-1940s-1990s) extracted all the human faces which were photorealistically depicted in TIME magazine's archive, covering 3,389 issues dating from 1923 to 2014. The research team (partly automatically) classified each of these instances as belonging to the 'male' or 'female' gender. For this exam question, we have preprocessed and reformatted their data (available from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YAT5QK)) into two new, easy-to-use datasets (`time/time-year.csv` and `time/time-season.csv`) that you will need for answering the questions below."
